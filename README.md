# Short Intro
I am a CEE student interested in learning about GIS and application of python in spatial analysis. I am curious about climate data-emission, economic development, transportation networks, finding optimal path, travel behavior, electric vehicles, intelligent transportation systems, smart cities, active transportation, multi-modal transportation, transportation + data science, and freight routes. I look forward to collaborating with you all.
