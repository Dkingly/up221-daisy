# GET TO KNOW ME: 
### WELCOME TO MY SPACE OF CREATIVITY AND INNOVATIVE IDEAS IN GIS/SDS 
I am a CEE student interested in learning about GIS and application of python in spatial analysis. I am curious about climate data-emission, economic development, transportation networks, finding optimal path- simulation, travel behavior, electric vehicles, intelligent transportation systems, smart cities/urban design, active transportation, transportation trends, multi-modal transportation, transportation + data science, and freight routes. I look forward to collaborating with you all and making a difference.
